# Week 3 Practical

Your team is required to create a plan for a summer camping trip. With the members of
your assigned group:

1. Select a product owner.
2. Create a repository and add the members as collaborators.
3. Add a plan.md file to the repository.
4. Create a GitHub project board to manage your issues and pull requests.
5. Create some issues (remember to assign people and the issues to the project board) relating to planning your camping trip. Suggested issue topics include:
    - Type of trip: wild camping, regular camping site or glamping?
    - Location: where in Ireland are you going to go camping?
    - What equipment do you need to bring along?
    - What are you going to do for entertainment or food?
6. To resolve issues (undertaking project work) will require adding sections in the plan.md file relating to each topic. DO NOT contribute directly to the plan.md file in the main branch. Instead use the GitHub workflow:
    - Create a feature-branch for your topic,
    - Make proposed changes to the plan.md file in the feature-branch,
    - Create a pull request for the proposed changes. Remember to specify the project and reviewer when creating the pull request.
